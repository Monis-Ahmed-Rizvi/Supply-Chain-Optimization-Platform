# Supply Chain Optimization Platform

## Overview
This project implements a web-based platform for optimizing supply chain logistics using advanced machine learning models. The platform forecasts demand, identifies bottlenecks, and optimizes resource allocation to enhance overall supply chain efficiency.

## Features
1. Demand Forecasting: ML-driven prediction of future product demand
2. Bottleneck Identification: Automated detection of supply chain inefficiencies
3. Resource Allocation Optimization: AI-powered suggestions for optimal resource distribution
4. Interactive Dashboards: Real-time visualization of supply chain metrics
5. Scenario Planning: What-if analysis for different supply chain strategies
6. Inventory Management: Optimal inventory level recommendations
7. Supplier Performance Tracking: Monitoring and analysis of supplier reliability and efficiency

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: 
  - Python for core logic and ML model deployment
  - FastAPI for RESTful API development
  - Optimization libraries: PuLP, SciPy
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
- **Frontend**: 
  - Vue.js or React for building responsive user interfaces
  - D3.js or Chart.js for advanced data visualization
- **Databases**: 
  - SQL: PostgreSQL for transactional and relational data
  - NoSQL: MongoDB for distributed and unstructured data storage
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: 
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - AWS Lambda for serverless computing
  - Amazon S3 for data lake storage
  - Amazon ECS or EKS for containerized deployment

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-optimization.git
   cd supply-chain-optimization
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

4. Set up databases:
   - PostgreSQL (refer to `docs/postgres_setup.md`)
   - MongoDB (refer to `docs/mongodb_setup.md`)

5. Configure AWS services (refer to `docs/aws_setup.md`)

6. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

7. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run serve  # for Vue.js
   # or
   npm start  # for React
   ```

## Key Components
1. **Data Ingestion**: AWS services for real-time and batch data ingestion
2. **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured data
3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Python-based ML models for demand forecasting and optimization
4. **Optimization Engine**: Custom algorithms for resource allocation and bottleneck resolution
5. **API Layer**: FastAPI for providing RESTful endpoints
6. **Frontend Dashboard**: Vue.js or React-based interface for data visualization and user interaction

## Development Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/Vue.js/React code formatting
- Write unit tests for all new features (pytest for backend, Jest for frontend)
- Document all functions and APIs using docstrings and JSDoc
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application
- Use feature branches and pull requests for code reviews

## Deployment
Refer to `deploy/README.md` for detailed instructions on deploying the system to AWS.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Utilize AWS CloudWatch for system monitoring and logging
- Implement automated alerts for critical system events and anomalies
- Regularly update ML models based on new data and performance metrics
- Conduct periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced ML techniques like reinforcement learning for dynamic optimization
- Develop a mobile app for on-the-go supply chain monitoring
- Integrate with IoT devices for real-time tracking of goods and materials
- Expand the platform to support multi-language and multi-currency operations
- Implement blockchain for enhanced supply chain transparency and traceability
